Crypto Application

**Crypto App**
employs symmetric key encryption technique to build an android based application named CRYPTO which uses customized cipher algorithm to encrypt the text to some binary coded string. 
Cryptography is about constructing and analysing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages, the same way CRYPTO takes in the normal readable string in text format and decodes it to binary non-understandable code, and is also capable of decrypting the binary code which is encrypted by the same algorithm as implemented in this application.
The user can copy the encrypted code from the application and use it according to its need.

**1. INTRODUCTION:-**
In today’s era, virtual security is at par with physical security, as more of our work is transforming
to digital means. Digital world provides us with way more opportunities and also a good amount
of reach with readily available tools at less cost and manpower, than a normal offline work. But
we know with all sorts of ease comes risk, which could be in a form where the confidential data
could be breached, modified, delayed, and this could directly impact the work, and also could have
adverse effects on personal life of the user.
As we saw many social media companies comes up with end-to-end encryption so that no data of
the user could be leaked. Why all this is needed? And how all this is done? Is what we are going
to discuss here.

**1.1 OverView**
There is a symbiotic relationship between cryptography and the development of highperformance computing systems. Modern-day computers were created at the behest of
twentieth-century cryptanalysts. As the complexity of cryptographic systems progressed from
mechanical to electronic systems, so did the need to develop more efficient methods to
cryptanalyze them.
The idea to develop an android based application, to perform encryption and decryption in
accordance with symmetric key encryption technique is implemented here.

**1.2 Objective**

• To encrypt a text message to some binary code, and also to decrypt the binary coded
string which was encrypted through same algorithm as used in the application.

• To provides us the idea of how the Cryptography has been used for everything from the
Allied forces sending military messages back and forth during WW2 to Julius Ceaser
using ciphers to send encrypted messages to his generals during ancient times.
